# Yelp-for-U-of-R

What is the project?
-A web application that lets users review, comment, and read reviews of various local food options.
Essentially, this app attempts to become a U of R Yelp application. If users want the ability to
review and comment, they will be prompted to create a username and password. Users will be able
to delete their previous posts. While reviewing a venue, users will be asked to specify the type
of food they are reviewing, the time of day, and any additional information that they might want
to include. Other users will the be able to visit the website and search for specific food options,
querying the database and displaying the results on the page.

Technologies used: 
-Python for scripting
-Django Web Framework for organizing for modularizing our web application, as well as providing a
template for the front-end component of our application 
-SQL Lite database to store our data

Who is the target audience for your Web application?
-Anybody that eats food at the U of R, including employees and visitors. Prospective students would
also be able to this application to have an honest analysis of the food options at the school.

How will it meet the minimum project requirements?
-This will be a CRUD application with an Ajax implementation. The user will be able to add, read, update,
and delete data from our database. The website will use Ajax to update the page asynchronously. 

Why is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond?
-In addition to being a basic CRUD application with Ajax, our web application will use unique tools such
as username and password functionality to limit access based on the type of user, as well as Django to
efficiently organize our program and provide a sleek user interface.
