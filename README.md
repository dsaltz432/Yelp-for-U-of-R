## Project Overview

Yelp for U of R is a web application that lets users write and read reviews for local food options. Without logging in, users are only able to read the reviews of others users. After creating an account and logging in, users are able to create reviews for new and existing restaurants, as well as to update their existing reviews. While reviewing a venue, users will be asked to specify the type of food they are reviewing, the time of day, and any additional information that they may want to include. Users can also search for specific food options.
